There is only one environment variable, and that is IPADDRESS, which sets the obvious. Once you've built the container, run it with `docker run -dt $imagename`

To test the configuration, run testconfig.sh with the hostname of the container you'd like to test as follows:
`sh testconfig.sh hostname`
